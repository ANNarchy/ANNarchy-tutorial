## About the slides

### Installation

The repository should be cloned with all its submodules:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ANNarchy/ANNarchy-tutorial.git
```

This package provides the basic files to generate a HTML5 + reveal.js presentation from Markdown code using `pandoc`. `pandoc` of course needs to be installed. 

To generate the html file:

```
make
```

The resulting HTML file has to be opened in a recent and decent browser (i.e. everything except IE).

### Shortcuts

* `f`: goes fullscreen.
* `e`: switches to printing mode (`?print-pdf` in the location bar). 
* `s`: opens presenter's view.
* `v`: goes black (pause).
* `m`: opens the menu to select slides.
* `c`: changes the cursor to a pen.
* `b`: opens a chalkboard.
* `CAPSLOCK`: changes the cursor to a laser pointer.
